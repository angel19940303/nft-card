# Frontend Mentor - NFT preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [NFT preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/nft-preview-card-component-SbdUL_w0U). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

**Mobile**

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

### What I learned

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
